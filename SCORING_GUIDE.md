## General Scoring Principles

### The 5 Cardinal Rules of CAPI Scoring

#### Rule 1: Evidence-Based Scoring
Every score must be justified with specific evidence. Never score based on "gut feeling" alone.

**Correct approach:**
"Scored 8/10 on Client Service Orientation because candidate led 3 successful client win-backs, increased client satisfaction scores by 15%, and received 2 client commendation letters."

**Incorrect approach:**
"Scored 8/10 because they seem good with clients."

#### Rule 2: Use the Full Scale
Don't cluster scores in the middle range (4-7). The full 0-10 scale exists for differentiation.

**Score Distribution Guidelines:**
- 0-2: Significant concerns or gaps
- 3-4: Below expectations, development needed
- 5-6: Meets minimum requirements
- 7-8: Above average, strong fit
- 9-10: Exceptional, rare excellence

#### Rule 3: Weight Context Appropriately
Consider the specific role level when scoring. A manager and senior manager will have different benchmarks.

#### Rule 4: Document Reasoning
Write 1-2 sentences explaining each factor score in the notes column. This creates an audit trail and helps calibrate future scoring.

#### Rule 5: Avoid Halo/Horn Effects
Score each factor independently. Don't let one strong/weak area influence other scores.
