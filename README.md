## 🎯 The CAPI Framework: 10 Critical Success Factors

### Overview
CAPI evaluates candidates across 10 weighted factors, generating a composite score from 0-100 points. Each factor is weighted based on its statistical correlation with long-term placement success.

```
CAPI Score Interpretation:
90-100: Exceptional Match (95%+ predicted retention)
80-89:  Strong Match (90%+ predicted retention)
70-79:  Good Match (85%+ predicted retention)
60-69:  Moderate Match (75%+ predicted retention)
<60:    Reconsider Match (Below acceptable threshold)
```

## 📈 CAPI Calculation Methodology

### Step 1: Raw Score Collection
Each factor is scored independently using the detailed rubrics above.

### Step 2: Weighted Score Calculation
```
Factor Score × Weight Percentage = Weighted Score

Example:
Factor 1 (CPA Status): 8 points × 12% = 0.96 weighted points
```

### Step 3: Composite Score Generation
Sum all weighted scores for final CAPI score (0-100 scale)

### Step 4: Confidence Interval
Apply ±5 point confidence interval based on interview quality and information completeness
